One Ticket To SteemFest\u2074&nbsp;\n2. Accommodation for the duration of the conference\n\n\nWhile this has you covered for the duration of SteemFest, as anyone attending Steemfest, you are able to get a share of the @t-r-f travel reimbursement fund which reimburses some of your travel expenses - depending on miles traveled and how many others apply.\n\n## One SteemFest Ticket Giveaway Including Accommodation\n\nThis giveaway is open to both existing members of the Steem Travel Community, as well as to travel bloggers and content creators currently outside of the chain.

Please keep in mind that the ticket is not transferable, so if you win and can\u2019t use the ticket, you\u2019ll be depriving someone else of the chance.\n\nHow To Earn Raffle Entries\n\n**IMPORTANT**: Before you can start earning entries to the raffle, [you need to log in to TravelFeed and opt in](https:\/\/travelfeed.io\/dashboard\/contest).\n\nEach raffle entry gives you a chance to participate in the final draw on October 18th, to win a ticket to SteemFest including accommodation.

Consider [voting](https:\/\/steemitwallet.com\/~witnesses) for @blocktrades and @ocd-witness if you appreciate what they are doing as much as we do!\n\n## 150 Steem Travel Writing Contest Is Still On\n\nIn case you haven't yet, don't forget to submit an entry to @invisusmundi 's [TravelFeed writing contest](https:\/\/steempeak.com\/@invisusmundi\/travelfeed-io-travel-writing-contest-no2). But hurry, the deadline is September 10th!\n\n## How to Get Involved?\n\nJoin the TravelFeed Community!\u00a0We invite anyone who\u2019s interested in travel to check out\u00a0[TravelFeed.io](https:\/\/travelfeed.io\/)\u00a0and to join our over 800-strong\u00a0[community on Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/jWWu73H). We\u2019re also looking for one more curator to join our team.\n\nWe \u2764\ufe0f Open Source: We are proud to make TravelFeed fully Open-Source, and support other communities on Steem who want to build on our code, which can be found on Github. We\u2019re still looking for contributors who want to work with us on the future of TravelFeed. We\u2019re in Beta and continuously improving the software, meaning that there are still some bugs. If you notice anything or have feedback for us, please don\u2019t hesitate to contact us on\u00a0[our Discord](https:\/\/discord.gg\/jWWu73H), leave a comment or open a bug report on our Github!\n\n## Consider Delegating To Us\nYour delegation not only supports the growth of this incredible project, but also helps the entire travel community on the Steem blockchain. Once we launch our token, the airdrop to delegators will be based on the amount of SteemPower delegated and your share of the total delegations for each day delegated. This means an advantage for early investors delegating now while our total delegations amount is only 127k SP: a number that we expect to be much higher in the near future. Our Steem Power is fully used for curation of the best TravelFeed posts and we provide temporary delegations of 15 SP to accounts created through us, to help with resource credits. Feel free to use the following links according to the amount you would like to delegate to\u00a0[@travelfeed](https:\/\/travelfeed.io\/@travelfeed):\n\n[100 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=100%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[250 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=250%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[500 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=500%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[1000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=1000%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[2500 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=2500%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[5000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=5000%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[10000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=10000%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[15000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=15000%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[25000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=25000%20SP)\u00a0|\u00a0[50000 SP](https:\/\/steemconnect.com\/sign\/delegateVestingShares?delegatee=travelfeed&vesting_shares=50000%20SP)\n\nAnd again, we'd like to thank every single delegator who believes and trusts in us. If TravelFeed becomes as successful as we are confident it will be, delegating to us is probably the investment with the highest ROI on Steem right now. \n\n## Winners of This Week's Round-up&nbsp;\n\nAnd with all this exciting news, we don't want to forget to highlight our three favorite submissions from this week, sharing a total of 6 Steem in rewards.\n\n### Three BEST posts of the week \n\nA quick recap - For the weekly round-up, we feature the best 3 posts out of the ones previously featured in the daily topic curation posts in the past week and on top of that 10 honorable mentions that closely did not make it into our resteems last week. The rewards will go to the first three places as follows: 1st place - 3 STEEM, 2nd place - 2 STEEM and 3rd place - 1 STEEM.\n\n<br>\n\ud83d\udd17 *The thumbnails are directly linked to the original posts.

Sieti\u0146iezis has changed a lot over time. One of the most recognizable sandstone arches is now collapsed. People are not much of a help either. Although it is forbidden to leave any markings on the sandstone, the whole surface seems to be riddled with them. Even at the highest, hardest to reach spots.
